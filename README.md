# Online-Registration-Form

##summery<br/>
On this project I was learning about HTML forms. I made a registration site comprized of mady form fields put togeter in a way that immitates a application.

##processes and tools used<br/>
*html<br/>
*css<br/>
*forms 
*git

##continued development<br/>
I would like to come back to this project and re-make it in react and also connect it to an data base so the fields would be fully functioning.
